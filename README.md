============

## How to:

1). First, you have to get the library. Download the version appropriate for your operating system (the application itself will run on all of them) from github and unzip it wherever you'd like.

2). go to the project folder and clone this repo

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:krazedkrish/emitit.git .
```

3). copy the nodejs webkit files from nw.js to emitit project folder

```bash
$ cd path/to/nw.js_folder/
$ cp * path/to/emitit_folder/
```
